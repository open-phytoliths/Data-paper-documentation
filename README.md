# DATA PAPER - Data from 'A dataset for assessing phytolith data for implementation of the FAIR data principles'.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7215572.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7215572)

This repository contains the datasets and documentation for the FAIR assessment conducted as part of the FAIR Phytoliths Project. 

This is the revised version after the integration of the reviewers´comments. The following files have been updated:
- Observations made during the FAIR assessment according to the set of questions table
- Specifications table (Detailed overview of the study design)
- Figure 1:  FAIR Phytoliths project workflow
- Table 1: Specifications table (overview of the study design)
- Supplementary table 1: Condensed standardised data dictionary (a full version of this table can be found in Github)

For more details of this project, please see our [website](https://open-phytoliths.github.io/FAIR-phytoliths/).

## What is the article about?
This paper aims to describe each step used (Full description of the experimental design, data acquisition, computational processing) in documenting and producing the data from the FAIR Phytoliths Project FAIR assessment. This study aims at assessing the quality (in terms of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability) of phytolith data sharing using two regional studies: Europe and South America. 

![FAIR Phytoliths Project Data Paper Workflow](https://github.com/open-phytoliths/FAIR-assessment-data-paper-documentation/blob/main/figure-1-FAIR-Phytolith-workflow-data-paper.jpg)
`Figure 1:  FAIR Phytoliths project workflow - the FAIR assessment is the workflow for the data paper and will be combined with the survey paper results to produce the first draft of the Community guidelines. Dotted lines indicate work packages still to be completed on the FAIR Phytoliths Project.`
