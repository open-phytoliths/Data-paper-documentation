# DATA PAPER - Data from 'A dataset for assessing phytolith data for implementation of the FAIR data principles'.

This repository contains the datasets and documentation for the FAIR assessment conducted as part of the FAIR Phytoliths Project.

## What is the article about?
This paper aims to describe each step used (Full description of the experimental design, data acquisition assays, computational processing) in documenting and producing the data from the FAIR phytolith assessment. This study aims at assessing the quality (in terms of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability) of phytolith data sharing using two regional studies: Europe and South America.
